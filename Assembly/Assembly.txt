This file is created to explain in details what and why we are using in the 3D design.

The .jpg files located in this folder are directly associated with this file.

Side part details:

As can be seen on the screenshot of the Side part, there are two holes.
The first one is needed to leak soap. A pipe is connected to the Micro Servo via wires, which triggers the action.
The second one is where the IR sensor located. Upon movement or heat, the sensor will send signal to the Micro Servo.
The Micro servo then moves the actual soap dispenser.

Bottom part details:

As it is shown on the screenshot of bottom part, there are three holes.
Each of them hold a different function. Particularly, the hole #3 is for the sensor wire,
while the hole #4 is needed to hold ropes to trigger the Micro Servo and thus, soap pump.
The hole #5 is where the whole firmware will be stored (Adruino R3, and Micro Servo). It's under the soap stand, so that it is not visible to others.

Top Part details:

There is an edge, side #6. It's needed to hold the IR sensor/keep stability and allow the detection of movement/heat near the soap dispenser.


The completed assembly of the 3D design may be found in another folder called "Complete Autosoap images".
It will take approximately 288g of plastic and 13 hours 56 minutes to print the whole thing.
