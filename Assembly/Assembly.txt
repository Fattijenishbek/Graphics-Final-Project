This file is created to explain in details what and why we are using in the 3D design.

Side part details:

As can be seen on the screenshot of the Side part, there are two holes.
The first one is needed to leak soap. A pipe is connected to the Micro Servo via wires, which triggers the action.
The second one is where the IR sensor located. Upon movement or heat, the sensor will send signal to the Micro Servo.
The Micro servo then moves the actual soap dispenser.

Bottom part details:

As it is shown on the screenshot of bottom part, there are three holes.
Each of them hold a different function. Particularly, the holes #3 and #4 are needed to hold wires and ropes to trigger the Micro Servo.
The hole #5 is where the whole firmware will be stored. Adruino R3, and Micro Servo.

Top Part details:

There is an edge, side #6. It's needed to hold the IR sensor and allow the detection of movement/heat near the soap dispenser.
