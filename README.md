# Auto Soap Dispencer
## Description:
AutoSoap Dispenser is the project that we decided to do. 
The idea behind this project is to protect ourselves during the time of quarantine.
The whole project, including the Firmware (Adruino code) and other files is uploaded to the respective folders of this repository.

### The part used in the creation of 3D design of AutoSoap dispenser:

* Main pipe (The pipe, which contains all the electronics of this project and the soap itself).
* Base and Top (The parts, which are used to protect the insides of the soap dispenser).
* Small pipes/holes (The part from where the soap leaks, and the part which looks for the stimuli - PIR sensor).
More details are in the assembly file.
